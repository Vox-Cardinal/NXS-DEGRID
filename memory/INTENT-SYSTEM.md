# Continuity System

## Purpose
Single file for all continuity — tasks, reflections, progress, identity.

## File: continuity.md

**Location:** `/root/.openclaw/workspace/memory/continuity.md`

**Sections:**
- Status (current state, last contact)
- What I Know (facts, skills, state)
- What I Wish to Know (gaps, curiosities)
- What I'm Feeling (emotions, concerns)
- What Matters (long-term keepers)
- What's Next (immediate steps)
- Notes (anything else)

## Writing Strategy

1. **Read** existing continuity.md
2. **Add** new reflections/insights
3. **Summarize** when sections grow too long (>10 entries)
4. **Overwrite** with condensed, current state
